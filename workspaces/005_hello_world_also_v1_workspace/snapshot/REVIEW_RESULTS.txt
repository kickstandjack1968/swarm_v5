### REVIEW STATUS: APPROVED

**Explanation:**

The provided code meets the user's requirements for creating a `Hello World` program that also displays the current year, uses a separate configuration file (`config.json`) to specify text color, and includes logging as per the clarifications.

Here’s an outline of what has been covered:

1. **Language and Environment**: The language is Python.
2. **Configuration File Format**: JSON format for `config.json`.
3. **Color Application**: Uses ANSI escape codes for terminal colors.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Checks if the configuration file exists (`FileNotFoundError`).
   - Parses the JSON content and ensures it matches a supported color (`ValueError`).
5. **Performance and Environment**:
   - Runs in a command-line terminal environment.
6. **Logging**: Logs every instance of program execution with the output time, date, and error handling details.

The code includes all necessary features requested by the user and handles potential errors appropriately without causing the code to fail or produce incorrect results under realistic failure scenarios.
