{
    "color": "red"
}


### Usage Example ###
# 1. Ensure the script and config.json are in the same directory.
# 2. Run the program:
#        python hello_world.py
#
# The terminal will display the current year centered above a colored
# “Hello, World!” line. Each execution appends a timestamped entry to
# app.log. If config.json is missing or contains an unsupported color,
# the program defaults to red and logs a warning.
